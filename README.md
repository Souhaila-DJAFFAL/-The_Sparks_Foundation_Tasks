Task 01 : Optiocal Character Recognition (OCR) 

Hello and welcome  everybody this is DJAFFAL Souhaila,

this is my project for the Optical Character Recognition task which is my first task for GRIP internship 

I have choosen offline OCR for Machine printed text in image . 


The goal of OCR is to take an input image and output raw text while maintaining the structure of the text in the image.
In othere words, its end-goal is to preserve the line breaks, paragraph segmentation, and other features of the structure of the text on the page.

This project is devided into 2 parts :
1. Preprocesseing task which is an an essential step.to simply to get rid of all noise and to have better OCR results 
2. recognition task using PyTesseract

In this notebook i’ve used different librairies : 
1. PIL (Pillow) : used to Open an image
2. OpenCV : allows you manipulate an image 
3. Tesseract (PyTesseract) : OCR an image
  

The link contain :
1.	The image i’ve used and the resulting images of preprocessing task
2.	The code
